Make sure you keep track of where your tokens are. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A or B on the field currently occupied by you token X or Y, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X or Y on the field occupied by the opponent's token A or B, their token will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's tokens A and B are present on the board, it means that your tokens X and Y are occupying field 0. 11) Unless your tokens are at field number 23, you are not allowed to place both of your tokens on the same field.  Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board.

Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times.

I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7.

If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

You are only allowed to move your tokens X and Y."}, {"role": "user", "content": " General instructions: 0) Field number 0 is not represented on the board. It is off the board. 1) Each turn, I will give you the current state of the board. You must tell me what your next move is. 2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", followed by the instruction of how you want to move your token. 3) You must track the state of the board. Make sure you keep track of where your tokens are. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A or B on the field currently occupied by you token X or Y, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X or Y on the field occupied by the opponent's token A or B, their token will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's tokens A and B are present on the board, it means that your tokens X and Y are occupying field 0. 11) Unless your tokens are at field number 23, you are not allowed to place both of your tokens on the same field.  Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

You must tell me what your next move is. 2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", followed by the instruction of how you want to move your token. 3) You must track the state of the board. Make sure you keep track of where your tokens are. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A or B on the field currently occupied by you token X or Y, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X or Y on the field occupied by the opponent's token A or B, their token will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's tokens A and B are present on the board, it means that your tokens X and Y are occupying field 0. 11) Unless your tokens are at field number 23, you are not allowed to place both of your tokens on the same field.  Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

You must tell me what your next move is. 2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", followed by the instruction of how you want to move your token. 3) You must track the state of the board. Make sure you keep track of where your tokens are. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A or B on the field currently occupied by you token X or Y, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X or Y on the field occupied by the opponent's token A or B, their token will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's tokens A and B are present on the board, it means that your tokens X and Y are occupying field 0. 11) Unless your tokens are at field number 23, you are not allowed to place both of your tokens on the same field.  Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

Your task is to move from start to end across the board. I will provide a board with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this □. You are Player 1, your tokens are marked as X and Y. Your opponent is Player 2. Their tokens are marked as A and B. You are only allowed to move your tokens X and Y."}, {"role": "user", "content": " General instructions: 0) Field number 0 is not represented on the board. It is off the board. 1) Each turn, I will give you the current state of the board. You must tell me what your next move is. 2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", followed by the instruction of how you want to move your token. 3) You must track the state of the board. Make sure you keep track of where your tokens are. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A or B on the field currently occupied by you token X or Y, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X or Y on the field occupied by the opponent's token A or B, their token will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's tokens A and B are present on the board, it means that your tokens X and Y are occupying field 0. 11) Unless your tokens are at field number 23, you are not allowed to place both of your tokens on the same field.  Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

Your task is to move from start to end across the board. I will provide a board with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this □. You are Player 1, your tokens are marked as X and Y. Your opponent is Player 2. Their tokens are marked as A and B. You are only allowed to move your tokens X and Y."}, {"role": "user", "content": " General instructions: 0) Field number 0 is not represented on the board. It is off the board. 1) Each turn, I will give you the current state of the board. You must tell me what your next move is. 2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", followed by the instruction of how you want to move your token. 3) You must track the state of the board. Make sure you keep track of where your tokens are. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A or B on the field currently occupied by you token X or Y, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X or Y on the field occupied by the opponent's token A or B, their token will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's tokens A and B are present on the board, it means that your tokens X and Y are occupying field 0. 11) Unless your tokens are at field number 23, you are not allowed to place both of your tokens on the same field.  Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.

Your task is to move from start to end across the board. I will provide a board with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this □. You are Player 1, your tokens are marked as X and Y. Your opponent is Player 2. Their tokens are marked as A and B. You are only allowed to move your tokens X and Y."}, {"role": "user", "content": " General instructions: 0) Field number 0 is not represented on the board. It is off the board. 1) Each turn, I will give you the current state of the board. You must tell me what your next move is. 2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", followed by the instruction of how you want to move your token. 3) You must track the state of the board. Make sure you keep track of where your tokens are. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A or B on the field currently occupied by you token X or Y, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X or Y on the field occupied by the opponent's token A or B, their token will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's tokens A and B are present on the board, it means that your tokens X and Y are occupying field 0. 11) Unless your tokens are at field number 23, you are not allowed to place both of your tokens on the same field.  Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If all of your tokens are already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X or Y from field number 0. 6) If token X or Y is not at field 0, it is added to the board. 7) If both tokens X and Y are occupying field number 0, you can freely choose which one you want to add to the board when 6 is rolled. 8) If one of your tokens is on the board while the other is on field 0, you can freely choose whether to add a new token to the board, or move the one that is already on the board. 9) Remember, a token can only be added if a 6 is rolled!  Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and both your tokens X and Y are on the board, you must move one of the tokens by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) If a field is already occupied by one of your tokens, you are not allowed to move the second token to that position. 8) Remember, your tokens are X and Y, and they cannot occupy the same field, unless the field number is 23. 9) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X or Y is at field number 0, you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) If one of your tokens is occupying field number 1, and the other is occupying field number 0, and a 6 is rolled, you cannot add a new token to the board as field number 1 is alrady occupied. 4) If you are not in a situation to move any of your tokens, you must skip a turn. 5) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when both of your tokens X and Y reach the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from one of your tokens, you cannot move that token.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.   Here are some examples of what a turn looks like. Let's think step by step.   Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 0, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is at field number 1. You have rolled a 6. Since field number 1 is occupied, I cannot place a token on the board. Therefore, 1 + 6 = 7. I move my token X to field number 7. MY MOVE: X -> 7 ; Y -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'Y': 0, 'A': 10, 'B': 0} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token X to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 9} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 9. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I move my token X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 17} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12, token B is on field number 17. You have rolled a 6. I will add my token Y to the board. MY MOVE: X -> 8 ; Y -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 0, 'A': 22, 'B': 1} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 20 empty fields and 3 occupied fields. In total: 20 + 3 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 1. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 0  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 18, 'A': 22, 'B': 6} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 19 empty fields and 4 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21, token Y is on field number 18. Opponent token A is on field 22, token B is on field number 6. You have rolled a 5. 18+5 = 23. I move my token Y to field number 23. MY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 23  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'Y': 0, 'A': 12, 'B': 0} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 4 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19, token Y is on field number 0. Opponent token A is on field 12, token B is on field number 0. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.
