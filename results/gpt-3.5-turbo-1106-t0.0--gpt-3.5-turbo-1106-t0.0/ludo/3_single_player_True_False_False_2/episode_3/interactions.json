Where will you move your token?"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T01:40:36.123478", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "There are 19 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 2 = 21 fields. I have token X on field 21 and token Y on field 17. You have rolled 3. This is 3 fields away from my previous position. Since both tokens are on the board, I can try to move any of them. I decide to move my token X. Since 21 + 3 = 24, and 24 > 23, I cannot move token X. Therefore, I will move token Y. Since 17 + 3 = 20, I can move token Y to field number 20.
