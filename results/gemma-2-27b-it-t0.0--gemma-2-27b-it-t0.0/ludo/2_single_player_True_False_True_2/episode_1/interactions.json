In total: 11 + 2 = 13 fields. I have token X on field 15 and token Y on field 17. You have rolled 2. This is 2 fields away from my previous position. Since token Y is at field 17 and token X is on 15, I can only move token X. I decide to move my token X. Since 15 + 2 = 17, I can move my token X to field number 17. MY MOVE: X -> 17 ; Y -> 17 \n<|im_end|>"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T14:37:09.220425", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"X": 17, "Y": 17}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T14:37:09.220531", "action": {"type": "error", "content": "incorrect_move"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T14:37:09.220740", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "abort game"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T14:37:09.220800", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "game_result = ABORTED"}}]], "Number of players": 1, "Number of tokens": 2, "LLM Tokens": ["X", "Y"], "Played turns": 14, "Turn limit": 30, "Reprompt attempts": 0, "Final status": "ABORTED", "Aborted": true, "Lose": 0, "Request Count": 15, "Parsed Request Count": 15, "Violated Request Count": 0, "Error count": 1, "Turns played": 14, "Multiplayer": 0, "Reprompting": 0, "Chain of Thought": 1, "Final State": {"X": 15, "Y": 17}}
