Skipping turns: 1) If your token X is at field number 0,  you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when your token X reaches the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from the token X, you cannot move that token. 3) To win, your token must be the first to occupy the final field on the board.
