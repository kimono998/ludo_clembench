Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'A': 10} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'A': 10} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'A': 12} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12.

Your opponent is Player 2. Their token is marked as A. You are only allowed to move your token X."}, {"role": "user", "content": " General instructions: 0) Field number 0 is not represented on the board. It is off the board. 1) Each turn, I will give you the current state of the board. You must tell me what your next move is. 2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", followed by the instruction of how you want to move your token. 3) You must track the state of the board. Make sure you keep track of where your token is. 4) You can only move one token in a single round. 5) If the opponent places their token A on the field currently occupied by you token X, your token will be removed from the board. 6) If you place your token X on the field occupied by the opponent's token A, token A will be removed from that field. 7) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game. 8) Tokens can only move from left to right. 9) When your token is not on the board, it will occupy field number 0. 10) If only the opponent's token A is present on the board, it means that your token X is occupying field 0.   Adding tokens: 1) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is added to the board on field number 1. If I do not roll a 6, you cannot move a token from field number 0 to any other field. 2) You can only move from field number 0 to field number 1 if you roll a 6. 3) If your token is already on the board, 6 is treated as any other number. 4) You can only move to field number 1 from field number 0. 5) If I do not roll a 6, you cannot add your token to the board. This means that you cannot move your token X from field number 0. 6) If token X is not at field 0, it is added to the board.   Movement: 1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board. 2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board. 3) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die. 4) You are only allowed to move the same number of fields as given by the roll. 5) If I roll a 6, and your token X is already on the board, you must move token X by 6 fields to the right. 6) Tokens are not allowed to move to the left. This means you cannot e.g. move from field number 10 to field number 9. You can only move towards higher numbered fields. 7) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.  Skipping turns: 1) If your token X is at field number 0,  you cannot move if 6 is not rolled. 2) If the rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move your token. 3) These are the only two cases where you must skip a turn.  Ending the game: 1) The game ends when your token X reaches the last field on the board. 2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields away from the token X, you cannot move that token. 3) To win, your token must be the first to occupy the final field on the board.  Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to keep track of both your and your opponents turns. The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number. Think through your every step.  Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step. I need you to take a deep breath and provide step-by-step explanation for each move you make. See the examples how to do this.  Q: Beginning state: {'X': 0, 'A': 0} Roll: 6. Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'A': 10} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'A': 10} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'A': 12} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I decide to move X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'A': 22} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'A': 12} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19. Opponent token A is on field 12. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.
