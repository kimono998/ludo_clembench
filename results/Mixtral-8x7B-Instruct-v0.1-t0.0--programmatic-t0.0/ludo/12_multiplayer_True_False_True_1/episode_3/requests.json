Where will you move your token? A: There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1. MY MOVE: X -> 1  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 0, 'A': 10} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 1. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board. MY MOVE: X -> 0  Q: Current state: {'X': 1, 'A': 10} Roll: 1. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 1. Opponent's token A is on field number 10. You have rolled a 1. 1+1 = 2. I move my token to field number 2. MY MOVE: X -> 2  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 8, 'A': 12} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 8. Opponent's token A is on field number 12. You have rolled a 4. 8+4 = 12. I decide to move X to field number 12. This will remove opponent's token A. MY MOVE: X -> 12  Here is another example.  Q: Current state: {'X': 21, 'A': 22} Roll: 5. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 21. Opponent token A is on field 22. You have rolled a 5. 21+5 = 26. Since 26 > 23, I cannot move my token. MY MOVE: X -> 21  Q: Current state: {'X': 19, 'A': 12} Roll: 4. Where will you move your token? A: There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. My token X is on field number 19. Opponent token A is on field 12. You have rolled a 4. 19+4 = 23. I move my token X to field number 23.
