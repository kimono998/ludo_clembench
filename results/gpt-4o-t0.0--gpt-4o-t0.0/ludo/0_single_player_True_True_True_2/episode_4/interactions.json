Since 15 + 6 = 21, and field 21 is already occupied by token X, I will move token Y to field number 21.\n\nMY MOVE: X -> 21 ; Y -> 21"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T10:37:00.310192", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"X": 21, "Y": 21}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T10:37:00.310275", "action": {"type": "error", "content": "incorrect_move"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T10:37:00.310367", "action": {"type": "reprompt", "content": {"role": "user", "content": "INVALID MOVE: Token Y was moved incorrectly. \nPlease try again.\nCurrent state: {'X': 21, 'Y': 15}\nTurn number: 13, Roll: 6.
