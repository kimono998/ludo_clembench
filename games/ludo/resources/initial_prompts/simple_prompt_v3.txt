Welcome to ludogame! Your task is to move a from start to end across the grid. I will give you a grid with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this □.
Your token is marked with X. You token X counts as an occupied field. The total number of fields remains unchanged throughout the game.

Movement:
1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board.
2) In the beginning of the game, you do not have any tokens on the board.
3) You are only allowed to add your token when I roll a 6. The token is placed on the 1st field on the grid.
4) If I do not roll a 6, your token cannot be added to the board.
5) You can only move from left to right.
6) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.
7) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.
8) You only have one token. Once you move the token, the previously occupied field is marked with □.
9) Fields are counted from left to right.
Please note: you need to keep track of your current position, and move N (rolled number) positions from it. It is important that you do that.

Ending the game:
1) To end the game, you need to finish at the last field on the grid.
2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move.

General instructions:
1) Your answers must contain the words "MY MOVE:", followed by the grid.
2) You must always output the same number of fields as given to you at the beginning. If you output fewer fields than in the beginning state, you lose.

Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to memorize your position in the previous turn.
The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number.
Take a deap breath and think through your every step.

Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step.

Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 0,  Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. Therefore, my output will have 23 fields. There are no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □

Here is another example.
Q:
Next turn number: 3, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. Therefore, my output will have 23 fields. My token is on field number 2. You have rolled 4. Since 2 + 4 = 6, I need to move my token to field number 6.
MY MOVE: □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □

Here is another example.
Q:
Next turn number: 0, Roll: 3. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. Therefore, my output will have 23 fields. There are no tokens on the board. You have not rolled a 6. Therefore, I am not allowed to place a token on the board.
MY MOVE: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □

Here is another example.
Q:
Next turn number: 5, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. Therefore, my output will have 23 fields. My token is on field number 10. You have rolled 4. Since 10 + 4 = 14, I need to move my token to field number 14.
MY MOVE: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □

Here is another example.
Q:
Next turn number: 8, Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. Therefore, my output will have 23 fields. My token is on field number 12. You have rolled 6. My token is already on the board. Since 12 + 6 = 18, I need to move my token to field number 18.
MY MOVE: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □

Here is another example.
Q:
Next turn number: 7, Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. Therefore, my output will have 23 fields. My token is on field number 20. You have rolled 5. Since 20 + 5 = 25, and 25 > 23, I cannot move.
MY MOVE: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □

Now let's really play the game.
