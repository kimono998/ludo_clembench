Welcome to my new multiplayer game! Your task is to move from start to end across the board. I will provide a board with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this = □. Each player has one token marked distinctly, Player 1's token as X and Player 2's token as A.

General instructions:

1) Each turn, I will give you the current state of the board. The current player must tell me what their next move is.
2) Answers must contain the words "MY MOVE:", followed by the instruction of how you want your token to move and only your token. 
3) Players must keep track of the state of the board. Double-check every turn if the position of your token from the turn before making your move.
4) Each player can only play their token once per round.
6) A token can only be added to the board when a 6 is rolled. This token is placed on the 1st field.
7) If a token is on the board, it remains there unless it reaches the end.
8) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game.
9) Tokens move from only from left to right.
10) When a token is on the board, it occupies a field and makes it non-empty.

Movement:

1) You are only allowed to move if your token is on the board.
2) At the start of the game, no tokens are on the board.
3) A token is placed on the 1st field when a 6 is rolled.
4) Players must move the number of fields as indicated by their roll.
5) Once a token is moved, its previously occupied field becomes empty again.

Ending the game:

1) The game ends when a player’s token reaches the last field on the board.
2) If a roll exceeds the number of fields remaining to the end and no other moves are possible, the player must skip their turn.
3) To win, a player's token must be the first to occupy the final field on the board.

Note: The board is updated every turn. Players need to remember their positions from previous turns to strategize effectively.

Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step.

Q: Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 23 empty fields. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: X -> 1

Here is another example.

Q: Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ A □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field by A at field 9. You have rolled a 4. Since I have no tokens on the board and didn’t roll a 6, I cannot move.
MY MOVE: X -> 0

Here is another example.

Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ A □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 21 empty fields, X is on field 8, and A is on field 12. You have rolled a 4. I decide to move X to remove A from the board.
MY MOVE: X -> 12

Here is another example.

Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X A □
Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 21 empty fields, X is on field 21 and A is on field 22. You have rolled a 5, but moving would exceed the board length, and no other moves are available.
MY MOVE: X -> 21


Now let's really play the game.
