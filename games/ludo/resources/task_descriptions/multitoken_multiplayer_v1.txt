Welcome to my new game! Your task is to move from start to end across the board. I will provide a board with empty fields, marked as □. Each player has two tokens; Player 1's tokens are marked X1 and X2, and Player 2's tokens are marked Y1 and Y2.

General instructions:

1) Every turn I will give you the current state of the board, and it will be your turn to tell me your next move.
2) Your answers must contain the words "MY MOVE:", followed by the instruction of how you want your token to move.
3) Keep track of the board state. Check the positions of your tokens each turn before deciding your move.
4) No two tokens, even from the same player, can occupy the same field.
5) You can only move one of your tokens per round.
6) A new token can be introduced to the board when you roll a 6.
7) All tokens, once on the board, remain until they reach the end.
8) The number of fields is fixed at 23 throughout the game.
9) Tokens can only move from left to right.
10) When a token is on the board, it occupies a field and makes it non-empty.
11) A token can move on top of a token but two tokens cannot stay in the same field. The first token needs to be removed from the board.

Movement:

1) Movement is allowed only if you have a token on the board.
2) Initially, no tokens are on the board.
3) A token is added to the board on the 1st field when a 6 is rolled.
4) Without a roll of 6, and if you have tokens off the board, you cannot add a new one.
5) Move the number of fields as indicated by your roll.
6) Once a token is moved, the previously occupied field is marked with □ again.
7) Tokens can only be moved from left to right. 
8) If a token ends up on the same field with another token, The first token that arrived to the field needs to be removed from the board and start again. 


When deciding which token to move:

1) Consider your strategy carefully, whether to advance a token or block an opponent.
2) If moving any token would exceed the board length or be less advantageous, consider moving the token that is farther from the start.
3) Strategic moves to block the opponent's tokens should be considered to slow their progress.

Ending the game:

1) The game ends when both tokens of any player reach the last field on the grid.
2) If a roll is higher than the number of remaining fields for any token and no move can be made, state "no move possible."
3) Both tokens must reach the end to officially finish the game for that player.

Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to remember your position in the previous turn.
The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number.
Think through your every step.


Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step.

Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Player: 1, Next turn number: 1, Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. There are no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X1 on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: X1 -> 1; X2 -> 0

Here is another example.

Q:
Current state: X1 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Player: 2, Next turn number: 2, Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied fields. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. I have no tokens on the board and my opponent has token X1 on field 1. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token Y1 on the board at field 1 and remove X1 from the board.
MY MOVE: Y1 -> 1; Y2 -> 0

Here is another example.

Q:
Current state: X1 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ Y1 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Player: 1, Next turn number: 5, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. I have 1 token on the board in field 1 and my opponent has token Y1 on field 13. You have rolled a 4. This is 4 fields away from my previous position. Since only my token X1 is on the board, I can move my token X1. Since 1 + 4 = 5, I move my token X1 to field 5.
MY MOVE: X1 -> 5; X2 -> 0

Here is another example.

Q:
Current state: □ □ □ Y1 □ X1 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Player: 2, Next turn number: 6, Roll: 2. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. I have token Y1 on field 4 and my opponent has token X1 on field 6. You have rolled a 2. This is 2 fields away from my previous position. Since only my token Y1 is on the board, I can move my token Y1. Since 4 + 2 = 6, I move my token Y1 to field 6 and remove my opponents token X1 from the board.
MY MOVE: Y1 -> 6; Y2 -> 0

Here is another example.

Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ Y1 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X1 □ □ □ □ □ □
Player: 1, Next turn number: 8, Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. I have token X1 on field 17 and my opponent has token Y1 on field 5. You have rolled a 6. Since only my token X1 is on the board, I can my token x1 or add another token to the board. I am ahead of my opponent so I decide to add another token on the board. 
MY MOVE: X1 -> 17; X1 -> 1
